Step 1:
Loading the code :
	1. Download and install ccs 7.4 from http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Download_CCS, read documentation on how to install and set 	up environment properly.
	Make sure to flash mmwave sdk 1.02 on mmwave using Unifash tool
	2.create new workspace
	3. Go to view -> target config
	4. create a new configuration, select XWR1642. XDS110 and test connection
	5. right click target configuration and launch it.
	6. select individually each of the XDS110 Debug and select connect to target
	7. Once both targets are connected, select the C674X_0 target, and click on the Load button in the toolbar to load dss (first config) 		located in (~/ti/demo/xwr16xx/mmw/xwr16xx_mmw_demo_dss.xe674 and ~/ti/demo/xwr16xx/mmw/xwr16xx_mmw_demo_mss.xer4f)
	refer to http://dev.ti.com/tirex/#/?link=Software%2FmmWave%20Sensors%2FIndustrial%20Toolbox%2FLabs%2FmmWave%20SDK%20Demo%20-%2016xx%	2FSetup%20Guide (for flashing mss and dss)

Step 2 :
Sending configuration file
	1. Download config file from mmwave visualiser. make sure all the check boxes at the bottom are checked. Edit config to remove all 		commented lines and sensor stop. 
	2. Download and open cutecom, set config port ( first port observed) and set baud rate 115200
	3. If there happens to be junk data when you open device, close device and open again
	4. Select to config file and send the file
	5. make sure the char delay is 10ms and uncheck Hardware option

Step 3 :
	1. To view the fft plot for the selected bins $ python plotDump.py
	make sure to edit data port inside the file
	2. once the frames are done recording, ctrl z to exit. pkill -9 python to stop program from running.
	
Step 4 :
Editing the code :
	1. To make changes to the code, move to ~/ti/demo/xwr16xx/mmw/mss/mss_main.c and change the respective start and stop range bins found 		in the MmwDEmo_mBoxReadTask function.
	2. to make:
	set environment : navigate to ~/ti/demo/xwr16xx/mmw folder and execute $ source setenv.sh
	$ cd ~/mmw
	$ make clean
	$ make all
	
	the two linker files .xer4f and .xe674 are created
	Make sure to have changed the start and stop range bins in the plotDump.py folder
